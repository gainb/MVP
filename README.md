# Mini-Chess-App
I created this small chess app that is linked to the Chess.com API. It is able to gather winrate statistics on any player registered on Chess.com. 
I also implemented a simple authentication system that is linked to a database on PostgreSQL. Users are also greeted with a daily chess puzzle on the home screen.
